# Description
This repo has been outdated, please look at the new repo here for the latest version of WFInfo: https://github.com/WFCD/WFinfo

~~WFInfo is a companion app for Warframe, based on the original WFInfo which is no longer developed. WFinfo is designed to fix a missing feature from Warframe, quick access to both Platinum and Ducat prices while selecting a fissure reward.~~

~~WFinfo provides recent platinum values from warframe.market of each primed item. This is accomplished all without affecting Warframe in any way.~~

# ~~Features~~

### ~~Fissure Prices~~

![Fissure Prices](https://i.imgur.com/Fl2z7qS.png)

~~To get the prices of the prime drops during a fissure event, press the assigned hotkey (Print Screen by default) during the reward screen. The Platinum and Ducat prices can either be displayed over Warframe itself or shown on a window located on a second screen. To make things easier there is also the Automation Mode, which will check Warframe if you are on the reward screen every second, If it finds any, it will display the Plat/Ducat values in your preferred way.~~

### ~~Relic Panel~~

~~The Relics panel allows you to look at all relics and see how much plat they award on average unrefined, and how much more platinum it awards when refined to radiant. Some relics this is small because the high plat items are common rewards, and others it is large because the rare reward is the high plat item.~~

### ~~Equipment Panel~~

~~The Equipment window allows you to look at each prime equipment and its parts. It shows how much each costs currently on warframe.market, and also shows how much it will cost to purchase a whole set of equipment. You also can mark items that you own, and it will adjust the total cost to only the remaining items.~~

##### ~~Note: For both of these info panels, there are several sorting options that allow you to find what is best for you. Also they have grouping features that allow you to see and sort all relics, or to only sort from one era, i.e. Lith.~~

# ~~Usage~~

~~1. Download the latest release from [latest release](https://github.com/random-facades/WFInfo/releases).~~
~~2. Run the .exe file.~~
~~3. Configure by clicking the cog icon in the lower right.~~
~~4. Press the hotkey on a fissure mission's reward screen (Or wait if set to auto)~~
~~5. An overlay will appear or a second window will appear with the info.~~
